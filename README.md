## How To Improve This Assignment For Future Classes

To make this assignment more effective as an official task, it could require the implementation of connecting this payment system to an actual database with mock bank accounts and transaction ledgers. For grading, automated test cases that cover a wider range of scenarios (e.g., transaction conflicts, invalid operations, and memory management) would be helpful for consistency. I think that an even cooler version of this assignment could involve learning how to use an actual payment processor API like Stripe and connecting that to a shopping front to process test transactions.
